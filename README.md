**Brief Description** 
The aim of this project is to create a java program that implements a personality test where we ask the user questions with multiple choice answers and give them a personality type based upon their specific combination of answers. The personality test asks the user questions to determine which character type (class) they align best with in the Dungeons and Dragons tabletop game. The class types are Fighter, Rogue, and Wizard. The personality test will match the user with a character type upon completion of the test. Each member contributed to the planning, code developement, and presentation of the Dungeons and Dragons Personality Test Application.
